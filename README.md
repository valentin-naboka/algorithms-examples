# algorithms-examples
Here you can find some examples of basic data structures and algorithms.

Implemented:
- stack data structure
- queue data structure

- tree traversal,
  both recursive and stack/queue implementations (pre-order, post-order, in-order, level-order)  

To run tests:
go test <repository folder>/....
